              Chamber of Commerce and Industry for MSME is an entity that was established with the noble aim of providing new directions and guidelines to the industrial
              and commercial sectors in Kerala. The Chamber is a grouping of individuals involved in Kerala’s varied industrial and commercial aspects. The aim of the
              Chamber is to assist those involved in these sectors in Kerala and to be a hand-holding to the new entrants in to this field and to lead them forward.
              Dynamic industrial expansion is an indispensable requirement for Kerala’s comprehensive growth. It can be seen that small scale industries are suited
              for Kerala's unique landscape. Small scale industries are the backbone of the nation’s economy. Keeping in account the changing circumstances, as per
              the MSME law of 2020, business or industries having an investment of Rs.1 crore to Rs.50 crores or having a turnover of Rs.5 crore to Rs.250 crores
              are listed as small-scale industries. Accordingly, there has been proclamation of 11 financial and technical schemes have been declared. In this
              context, groupings like the Chamber are inevitable for the comprehensive growth and progress of the small-scale industrial sector.
